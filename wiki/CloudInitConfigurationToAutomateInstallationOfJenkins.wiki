#summary CloudInit / cloud-config script to automate creation of Jenkins instance on Amazon EC2 and cloud environments

= CloudInit / cloud-config script to install Jenkins =

Jenkins can easily be installed in Amazon EC2 with [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CloudInit Cloud Init].
In the following example, Jenkins is set up in an [http://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/ Amazon Linux instance] using a Cloud Config file, one of the possible ways to do something during the first boot of a launched instance.

= cloud-config script =

{{{
#cloud-config

repo_additions:
 - source: jenkins
   filename: jenkins.repo
   name: Jenkins
   baseurl: http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat/
   key: http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins-ci.org.key
   enabled: 1

packages:
- jenkins

runcmd:
 - [ sh, -xc, "echo $(date) ': cloudinit runcmd begin'" ]
 - [service, jenkins, start ]
 - [usermod, -a, -G, jenkins, ec2-user]
 - [ sh, -xc, "echo $(date) ': cloudinit runcmd end'" ]
}}}

Details:
 * Jenkins repo is added to the list of yum repos of the server ({{{repo_additions}}} block),
 * {{{jenkins}}} package is installed ({{{packages}}} block),
 * {{{jenkins}}} is started ({{{runcmd}}} block),
 * user {{{ec2-user}}} is added to the {{{jenkins}}} group({{{runcmd}}} block).

Note that the {{{runcmd}}} commands must be written in a valid yaml syntax.

= Launching the new instance =

You will find below two different ways of launching a node with the new configuration. The first one shows how to do it through the wizard of Amazon WS Management Console :

You can also do it through the command line making use of the [http://aws.amazon.com/developertools/351 aws-tool API].

= Troubleshooting CloudInit =

Some tips that will help you debugging your cloud init script :

== Logs ==

Cloud init logs files :
 * {{{/var/log/messages}}}
 * {{{/var/log/cloud-init.log}}} 

== How to relaunch CloudInit script ==

 * In order to launch cloud-init without having to create a new instance, you can just erase the semaphores existing in {{{/var/lib/cloud/sem/}}} and run cloud-init with the your new config :
{{{
[ec2-user@ip-10-234-133-197 sem]$ sudo rm /var/lib/cloud/sem/*
[ec2-user@ip-10-234-133-197 log]$ sudo /etc/init.d/cloud-init start
}}}

== How to debug "Failed loading of cloud config ..." ==

Sample logs in {{{/var/log/messages}}}
{{{
Sep 19 20:39:00 ip-10-226-234-218 [CLOUDINIT] 2011-09-19 20:39:00,754 - cloud-init-cfg[INFO]: cloud-init-cfg ['mounts']

...
}}}

To debug this kind of problem, first verify that the cloud-config.txt file is valid yaml:
{{{
$ python
Python 2.6 ...
>>> import yaml
>>> stream = open("/path/to/cloud-config.txt", "r")}}}
>>> yaml.load(stream)
}}}

Call to {{{yaml.load(stream)}}} validates your yaml file.
